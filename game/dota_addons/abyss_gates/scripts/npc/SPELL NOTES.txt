SPELL NOTES


Name 						Working						Animation	 		Tooltip					Notes

Heal Aura 					Yes							Yes					No						Heals, does not increase HP Regen. Might need to be changed. Animation might be too intrusive.

Immune AOE Channel 			Yes							Yes					No 						Gives physical and magical immunity. Enemies will ignore afflicted targets. Might need to be changed.

Root Treant Spawn			Yes							Yes					No 						Not sure about root animation duration. Treant spawns but is controllable. Will need to be fixed.					

Heal Over Time				Yes							Yes					No 						100%						

Perm Attribute Buff			Yes							Yes					No 						Buffs do not consolidate. Either hide buff or find a way to merge. Buffs persist through death. 
																									Is that correct? Maybe make animation more flashy						

Volcano						Half						Half				No 						Animation is probably too small, don't know correct radius. Multiple volcanoes only deal one source
																									of damage. Does radius increase based off of life time or volcano instance?

Reflect Shield				Yes							No 					No 						Abaddon shield animation not showing. Need explosion animation too. 						

Stone Fist					Yes							No 					No 						Needs all animation 						

Divine Light				Yes							No 					No 						Needs all animation

Fire Aura 					Yes 						No 					No 						Needs all animation. If you spam toggle it drains additive mana per second
